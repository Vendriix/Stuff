JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages on earth
and is used to add interactivity to webpages,
process data, as well as create various applications
(mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and more)

The type attribute: <script type="text/javascript"> is also no longer required, 
as JavaScript is the default HTML scripting language.


Naming rules:
- The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
- Variable names cannot include a mathematical or logical operator in the name. For instance, 2*something or this+that;
- JavaScript names must not contain spaces
